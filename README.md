# How to use Docker to "build" this draft?

In the root folder type

`% make`

or

`% make container`

# Where will I find the generated drafts?

Docker mounts the file system from the host it runs on. Therefore the output of the command is deposited back on the host file system. 

If the build is successful, you will find the generated drafts in the draft/ folder.
